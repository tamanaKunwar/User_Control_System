# User_Control_System
The user will sign up to the app and then he will login and he can control other users like deleting the users.

## How to run the project:
1. First of all we need to run the project using command "python manage.py runserver", this will start the server.
2. Go to browser and open up the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/
3. It will redirect user to the login page where he has to login with username and password.
4. Once he is logged in with correct id and password, it will redirect him to Profile page where he will be able to see other users and        can control them.
5. If the user is new user and he is not having login credentials then he has to do sign up.
6. Finally he can logged oout from Profile page.

## ToDo:
Need to show list of all users and need to add functionality of deleting the users.
